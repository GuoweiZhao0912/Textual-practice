I have done some simple text analysis exercises implemented in Python, including:   Chinese and English word segmentation,   word frequency statistics,   bag-of-words model,   TF-IDF,   word embedding models,   and text sentiment analysis.
also， I practice some basic algorithm like PCA，Lasso，Tree and forest
